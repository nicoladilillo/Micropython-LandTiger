/*
Uses the low 8 bits of the hrtimer to give the number of cycles per scan.
The cycles per scan depends on many factors including network activity.
Network activity has a high entropy as it depends on many machines and human activity.
The minimum scan is typically at least 5000 so taking the low 8 bits should be indeterminate.
